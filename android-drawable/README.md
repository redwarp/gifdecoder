# android-drawable

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/app.redwarp.gif/android-drawable?style=flat-square)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/app.redwarp.gif/android-drawable)

An implementation of an Android Drawable, using the decoder, as a simple way to display a gif in an
Android app.

## Setup

`android-drawable` is available on `mavenCentral()`

Add it to your dependencies with `implementation "app.redwarp.gif:android-drawable:x.y.z"`

In code, create a GifDrawable from any InputStream.
GifDrawable implements `Animatable2Compat` , a user needs to call `start()` to start the animation.

```kotlin
// Example: with a gif included in your app as an asset
val inputStream = context.assets.open("some_animated.gif")

val drawable:GifDrawable = GifDrawable.from(inputStream)
drawable.start()

imageView.setImageDrawable(drawable)
```

## Dependencies

This library depends on:
* AppCompat, as the `GifDrawable` implements [Animatable2Compat](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/vectordrawable/graphics/drawable/Animatable2Compat).

## Alternatives

If you target Android 28, [AnimatedImageDrawable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/AnimatedImageDrawable) is good and efficient.
Below 28, it's not crystal clear what should be used.

Coil and Glide both bake their own version of a Gif decoder.

* The Coil version relies on the `Movie` class and is quite expensive in term of memory and CPU usage. See [MovieDrawable](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/coil-gif/src/main/java/coil/drawable/MovieDrawable.kt).
* The Glide version is decent, see [StandardGifDecoder](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/blob/master/third_party/gif_decoder/src/main/java/com/bumptech/glide/gifdecoder/StandardGifDecoder.java).
